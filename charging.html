		I know that making a website can be quite expensive. I am here to make your life easier. 
		Money is not my concern right now. Of course, I will charge money for the website but I am not building your website for the money. 
		With that being said, I charge more money for the more features you need on your website. Please <a href = "contact.html">contact me</a>and we will negotiate the price.
